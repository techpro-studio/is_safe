Root / Jailbreak detection for Flutter Android/iOS app

For iOS Jailbreak detection was used [This great detector](https://github.com/avltree9798/isJailbroken)


Frida detection works Fine only with APK!!!!

For Android Root detection was used [Root beer](https://github.com/scottyab/rootbeer) + [Frida detector](https://github.com/darvincisec/DetectFrida) to ensure that root detection was not hacked
